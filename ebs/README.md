# ebs/ - Elastic Beanstalk directory
There we have all necessary files that is __.ebextensions/__ directory with files and __Buildfile__ and __Procfile__. Why we need this files?
Just deploy application to beanstalk by one command we couldnâ€™t because our application needs to run some commands. So for extending functionality of our environment we need these files. 
So for deploying Gerrit to Beanstalk we using ebcli tool - it is tool powered by AWS for managing Beanstalk environment using CLI.
So the deploy process start from `eb deploy` command
The deploying starts from __.ebextensions/__ dir where we have three files:
 
 - 01_mount - mount EFS volume to our application server.
 - 02_init - creating necessary subdirectories for application
 - 03_staging - change some preferences in the config file of our application.

 Then our environment will start commands that are defined in __Buildfile__ and __Procfile__. 

 - Buildfile - run init command for first initialization of our application.
 - Procfile - start our application as a systemd service.

Commands from these files running in order __.ebextensions/ commands --> Buildfile --> Procfile --> Running application.__
